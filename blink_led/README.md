# Simple LED Blink Program on ATmega8 (PORTB0)

This simple program blinks an LED connected to the PORTB0 pin of an ATmega8 microcontroller. The LED will turn on for 1 second, then off for 1 second, repeatedly.

## Hardware Setup
- **Microcontroller**: ATmega8
- **LED**: Connected to **PORTB0**
- **Resistor**: A current-limiting resistor is recommended (e.g., 220Î©).

## Program Description
The program toggles the LED on PORTB0, turning it on for 1 second, then off for 1 second, using simple delay loops. The delay is implemented in both Assembly and C versions.
