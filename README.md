# AVR  
A personal collection of AVR microcontroller projects Iâ€™ve worked on and learned from.

## Projects

- **[blink_led](./blink_led)**  
  A simple project that blinks an LED using AVR.  
  Great for learning basic digital output.

- **[seven_segment_increase_times](./seven_segment)**  
  Uses a seven-segment display to increment numbers over time.  
  Demonstrates control of display hardware.

- **[key_press_counter](./key_press_counter)**  
  Counts how many times a button is pressed.  
  A practical example of input handling.

- **[LCD16x2](./lcd16x2)**
